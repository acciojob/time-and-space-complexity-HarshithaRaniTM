	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity of the program is O(nk), where n is the number of words and k is the maximum line width. This is because the program computes the solution to each subproblem once and stores the result in the memoization table, so each subproblem is efficient.</p>
	<p><b>Space complexity</b> of the program is also O(n), because the memoization table is a 2D array with n rows and k+1 columns.)</p>
